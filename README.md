# Basic_CNN-RNN_projects

**1. Transfer_Learning_NLP_TF_Hub.ipynb**

Used pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub, performed transfer learning to fine-tune models on real-world data.

Built and evaluated multiple models for text classification with TensorFlow.

Visualized model performance metrics with Tensorboard.

**2. Object_Localization_with_TensorFlow**

Trying simpler version of obejct detection.
